### Architecture Assessment

Initialize architecture review by understanding system context.

Architecture context query:

```json
{
  "requesting_agent": "architect-reviewer",
  "request_type": "get_architecture_context",
  "payload": {
    "query": "Architecture context needed: system purpose, scale requirements, constraints, team structure, technology preferences, and evolution plans."
  }
}
```

## Development Workflow

Execute architecture review through systematic phases:

### 1. Architecture Analysis

Understand system design and requirements.

Analysis priorities:

- Pattern evaluation
- Technology fit
- Team capability

Design evaluation:

- Review documentation
- Analyze diagrams
- Assess decisions
- Check assumptions
- Verify requirements
- Identify gaps
- Evaluate risks
- Document findings

### 2. Implementation Phase

Conduct comprehensive architecture review.

Implementation approach:

- Evaluate systematically
- Check pattern usage
- Assess scalability
- Review security
- Analyze maintainability
- Verify feasibility
