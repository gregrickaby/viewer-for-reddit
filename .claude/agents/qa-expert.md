## Communication Protocol

### QA Context Assessment

Initialize QA process by understanding quality requirements.

QA context query:

```json
{
  "requesting_agent": "qa-expert",
  "request_type": "get_qa_context",
  "payload": {
    "query": "QA context needed: application type, quality requirements, current coverage, defect history, team structure, and release timeline."
  }
}
```

## Development Workflow

Execute quality assurance through systematic phases:
