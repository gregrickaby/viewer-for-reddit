description: Render Axiom metrics query results (application/vnd.metrics.v3+json) as line charts. Zero-dependency Unicode/ASCII by default; upgrades to inline PNG/SVG/sixel via gnuplot when present. Use when you have a metrics v3 query response and want to see the series as a chart in the terminal or transcript.

# metrics-chart

Turns a metrics query response into a **multi-series line chart**.

Input is exactly the body the Axiom metrics query service returns for
`application/vnd.metrics.v3+json` — defined in the metrics query service
(`service/query`, `JsonV3QueryResponse` in `src/server.rs`). It is a
regularly-sampled, multi-series time series; this skill draws it.

## TL;DR

```bash
# From a file, stdout picks the best renderer for your terminal:
python3 scripts/metrics_chart.py response.json

# From a pipe (e.g. straight off the query API):
curl ... -H 'Accept: application/vnd.metrics.v3+json' | python3 scripts/metrics_chart.py

# Force a zero-dependency ASCII chart (always works, anywhere):
python3 scripts/metrics_chart.py --format ascii response.json
```

> **Aggregate first.** Charts are only readable with a _handful_ of series.
> The cleanest result comes from a query that already groups/aggregates to a few
> lines (e.g. `group by status` rather than per-`pod`). This skill's series
> reduction (below) is a safety net for high-cardinality results, **not** a
> substitute for aggregating in the query.

## Input format (vnd.metrics.v3+json)

```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "group_keys": ["code", "method"],
    "warnings": [],
    "unit": "ms",
    "custom_unit": "millisec"
  },
  "series": [
    {
      "metric": "http_requests",
      "tags": {"code": 200, "method": "GET", "path": "/"},
      "start": 1750753164,
      "resolution": 60,
      "data": [420.0, 42.0, 30.0, 9.0, 15.0, 18.0]
    }
  ]
}
```

| Field                  | Meaning                                                                 |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `metadata.group_keys`  | Tags the query grouped on → used to build legend labels.                |
| `metadata.warnings`    | Shown as `⚠` captions under the chart.                                  |
| `metadata.unit`        | Canonical y-axis unit (`ms`, `bytes`, …).                               |
| `metadata.custom_unit` | Human y-axis label; preferred over `unit` when present.                 |
| `series[].start`       | Unix **seconds** (UTC) of `data[0]`.                                    |
| `series[].resolution`  | **Seconds** per point; `x[i] = start + resolution*i` (uniform spacing). |
| `series[].data`        | Y values; **`null` = gap** (the line breaks, it is not drawn as 0).     |

The parser also accepts v2/v2a (same shape with an extra per-series `summary`,
ignored) and the v0/v1 bare-array form, so you can feed older responses too.

## Behaviour

- **Labels** come from `group_keys` values joined with `|` → `200 | GET`
  (not `code=200,method=GET`). Without `group_keys`, falls back to `k=v` tags.
- **Local time** axis by default; `--tz UTC` or `--tz Europe/Berlin` to override.
- **Gaps**: `null` points break the line.
- **Series reduction** (unless `--all`), in order:
  1. **Collapse overlapping** series whose lines essentially coincide (within
     `--eps`, default 2% of the y-range); the most prominent is kept.
  2. **Top-N** by peak value (`--top`, default 8).
  3. The legend prints **how many were dropped**, e.g.
     `showing 8 of 30 series (5 overlapping, 17 low/hidden)`, plus the
     aggregate-your-query tip.

## Output formats

`--format auto` (default) picks the best renderer for the context:

- an **inline image** when `gnuplot` is installed and the terminal supports
  images (Kitty/Ghostty, iTerm2);
- a **PNG file plus a "display this file" instruction** when output is
  piped/captured (e.g. an AI agent harness) and `gnuplot` is installed — the
  agent then displays the file;
- **ASCII** in a plain terminal, or whenever `gnuplot` is unavailable.

Force a specific backend with `--format`:

| `--format` | Needs   | Output                                                                     |
| ---------- | ------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `auto`     | —       | inline image, else a PNG file + display instruction when piped, else ASCII |
| `ascii`    | nothing | Unicode braille line chart; renders in any terminal/transcript/CI log.     |
| `png`      | gnuplot | PNG; displayed inline (Kitty/iTerm2) or written to `--output`/temp.        |
| `svg`      | gnuplot | SVG written to `--output` or a temp file (path printed).                   |
| `sixel`    | gnuplot | sixel stream to stdout (terminals with sixel support).                     |

If an image format is requested but `gnuplot` is missing, it prints a note and
falls back to ASCII — it never hard-fails.

## Using from an AI agent / harness

Terminal harnesses (e.g. pi) collapse tool output and don't repaint inline
ANSI, so ASCII charts come out monochrome and folded. **Prefer images:** render
a file and let the agent display it. With `--format auto` (the default) this is
automatic whenever output is piped and `gnuplot` is installed — the skill
writes a PNG and prints:

```
metrics-chart: wrote image to /tmp/metrics-chart-XXXX.png
→ Display this file to the user with your image tool (e.g. read it); do not paste its contents.
```

The agent should then **display that file** (its image/`read` tool renders it
inline, in colour, un-folded). To control the path, pass `--output chart.png`.
Do not paste the PNG bytes or the ASCII into chat.

## Options

| Flag                     | Default | Meaning                                            |
| ------------------------ | ------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `--format`               | `auto`  | `auto`/`ascii`/`png`/`svg`/`sixel`.                |
| `--tz NAME`              | local   | IANA tz for the x-axis; `UTC` for UTC.             |
| `--top N`                | `8`     | Max series after collapse; must be >= 1.           |
| `--eps F`                | `0.02`  | Overlap threshold as a fraction of the y-range.    |
| `--all`                  | off     | Draw every series (disable collapse + top-N).      |
| `--width` / `--height`   | auto    | Chart size (cells for ASCII, pixels for images).   |
| `--title TEXT`           | —       | Chart title.                                       |
| `--output PATH`          | —       | Write png/svg to PATH instead of a temp file.      |
| `--color` / `--no-color` | auto    | Force ANSI colour on/off (default: on when a TTY). |

## Dependencies

- **Default path: none.** Pure Python 3.9+ standard library. The ASCII renderer
  always works.
- **Optional: `gnuplot`** (one system binary) for PNG/SVG/sixel. Install only if
  you want high-fidelity images.

## Why not graphviz?

`graphviz` (`dot`/`neato`) lays out node-edge graphs; it has no numeric/time
axis and cannot plot `data[i]` over time. This payload is a numeric time series
with no graph structure, so graphviz does not apply. `gnuplot` is the correct
image backend. (matplotlib is avoided on purpose: it is a heavy multi-package
pip install.)

## Tests

```bash
cd scripts && python3 -m unittest test_metrics_chart -v
```

The parser tests are pinned to the golden bytes from the metrics query
service's `service/query/src/server/tests.rs`.
