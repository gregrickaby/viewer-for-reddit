# About Viewer for Reddit

Viewer for Reddit features a private, distraction-free way to experience Reddit.com. There are no ads or ranking algorithms. It's fast and media-focused, built to show images, GIFs, and videos cleanly.

## Quick start

1. Explore popular posts: go to [the homepage](https://reddit-viewer.com).
2. Find a community: type a community name (e.g. `pics`) into the search at the top of this page, and select a result to view posts.
3. Favorite communities: click the heart icon next to a community name to add it to your favorites. After, you can view your favorite posts on the [homepage](https://reddit-viewer.com).

## What's under the hood?

Viewer for Reddit is built with [Mantine](https://mantine.dev/) and [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/). State management and data fetching are handled by [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) and [RTK Query](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/rtk-query/overview), with _all data_ coming from Reddit’s public [REST API](https://www.reddit.com/dev/api).

## Who?

Viewer for Reddit has been maintained by me, [Greg Rickaby](https://gregrickaby.com), since 2020. It's a super fun side project! A place where I can experiment with web technologies and build something useful for myself and others. I’ve been a Reddit user and web developer for over 20 years.
