## How It Works

**No account? No problem.** Jump in and start browsing right now. The homepage shows popular posts, and you can search for any community.

**Want more?** Sign in with your Reddit account to access your personalized feed, custom feeds, and saved posts. You can also vote on and save posts, plus join or leave communities.

**Your privacy is protected.** We use Reddit's official login system (oAuth2) so your password never touches our servers. We store temporary access tokens that get deleted when you sign out. That's it.

The app does anonymously tracks button clicks with Umami's [Track Events](https://umami.is/docs/track-events) system. The data is used to make the app better by guiding which features to build next.

## The Story Behind It

This side project started in 2020 as a fun way for me to learn TypeScript. It's grown into something with thousands of users, and I'm really proud of it. I use it every day and I'm always looking for ways to make it better.

## Who Built This?

I'm [Greg Rickaby](https://gregrickaby.com), a software engineer who's been around the internet for over 20 years. I built Viewer for Reddit because I wanted a cleaner, simpler way to browse Reddit and I thought others might too.
