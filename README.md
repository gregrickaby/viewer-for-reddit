- **Vote & comment** - Sign in with your Reddit account to participate.

## How It Works

**No account? No problem.** Jump in and start browsing right now. The homepage shows popular posts, and you can search for any community. Heart communities you like, and they'll appear on your homepage next time.

**Want more?** Sign in with your Reddit account to access your personalized feed, custom feeds, and saved posts. You can also vote and comment on posts.

**Your privacy is protected.** We use Reddit's official login system—your password never touches our servers. We store temporary access tokens that get deleted when you sign out. That's it.

We track some usage stats (what features you use, button clicks) with Umami's [Track Events](https://umami.is/docs/track-events) system to make the app better, but it's all anonymous and not connected to your Reddit account.

## The Story Behind It

This side project started in 2020 as a fun way for me to learn TypeScript. It's grown into something with thousands of users, and I'm really proud of it. I use it every day and I'm always looking for ways to make it better.

## Who Built This?

I'm [Greg Rickaby](https://gregrickaby.com), a software engineer who's been around the internet for over 20 years. I built Viewer for Reddit because I wanted a cleaner, simpler way to browse Reddit and I thought others might too.
