# Compliance Control → Audit Trail Query Mapping

## Scope Boundary

Datadog Audit Trail documents actions **within the Datadog platform**:

- Who logged in, from where
- Who changed monitors, dashboards, log pipelines, integrations, roles, API keys
- What the Bits AI assistant did on behalf of users

It does **not** document:

- Actions within systems that Datadog monitors (AWS, GCP, application servers)
- Content of data ingested by Datadog (logs, traces, metrics values)
- Network activity between user systems and Datadog
