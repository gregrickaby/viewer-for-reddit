# APM Service Remapping

> **Before acting:** Surface an impact preview (monitors/dashboards referencing the old service name) before presenting the planned rule. For inferred-entity remaps, also confirm `peer.service` is set on outbound spans. Variables from `## Context to resolve before acting` can be gathered alongside that preview rather than blocking it.

## How Service Remapping Works — Domain Knowledge

Read this before building any rule. It gives you the mental model to construct the right filter and catch edge cases.

**What remapping does:** A rule intercepts telemetry at ingestion time and rewrites the service name before indexing. A rule says: "for any entity matching this filter, replace its service name with this new value."

**Two entity types — pick the right one:**

| Entity type         | `rule_type` integer | What it targets                                                                                                                                  |
| ------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **SERVICE**         | `0`                 | Instrumented services — have spans with an explicit `service` tag set by a tracer                                                                |
| **INFERRED_ENTITY** | `1`                 | Auto-detected from outbound calls — named from `peer.service`. **Requires `peer.service` to be set on outbound spans** (see prerequisite below). |

**Prerequisite for inferred entity remapping — `peer.service` must be set:**

Inferred entity remapping only works when the tracer sets `peer.service` on outbound spans. Without it, entities are keyed by `peer.hostname` and remapping rules will not apply.

To enable this, set the following env var on the **instrumented service** (not the downstream dependency):

```bash
DD_TRACE_PEER_SERVICE_DEFAULTS_ENABLED=true
```

This makes the ddtrace tracer automatically propagate `peer.service` from `peer.hostname` on outbound HTTP, gRPC, and database calls. Without this, `pup traces search` will show spans with `peer.hostname` but no `peer.service`, and no service remapping rule will match.

To verify `peer.service` is being set before building a rule:

```bash
pup traces search --query "@peer.service:<ENTITY_NAME>" --from 15m --limit 5
```

If zero results — the tracer is not setting `peer.service`. Ask the user to add `DD_TRACE_PEER_SERVICE_DEFAULTS_ENABLED=true` to their service's environment and redeploy before continuing.

**Filter syntax** — a standard Datadog event-grammar query string:

| Goal                                 | Filter                          |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------- |
| Exact service match                  | `service:payments`              |
| All services with a prefix           | `service:deploy-test*`          |
| All services with a suffix           | `service:*.tropos`              |
| All services containing a string     | `service:*payments*`            |
| All inferred services under a domain | `peer.service:*.shopify.com`    |
| Service in one environment only      | `service:payments AND env:prod` |
| Multiple possible values             | `service:(payments OR billing)` |

> **Supported operations only:** The above forms — exact match, wildcards, `AND`/`OR` — are the only accepted operations. More advanced query syntax (CIDR ranges, numeric comparisons, fuzzy matching, etc.) is not supported and will be rejected by the API with a filter syntax error.

**New name syntax** — the `value` field in `rewrite_tag_rules`:

| Form                | Example                    | Use for                                          |
| ------------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Static string       | `my-service`               | Every matched entity gets exactly this name      |
| Tag interpolation   | `{{service}}`              | Substitute the full value of a tag               |
| Tag + regex capture | `{{service\|^(.+?)\..*$}}` | Extract part of a tag value (non-greedy capture) |

**Regex constraints for `{{tag\|regex}}`:**

- Maximum **1 capture group** per expression
- **No greedy quantifiers inside capture groups** — use non-greedy variants: `(.+?)` not `(.+)`, `(.*?)` not `(.*)`
- Quantifiers on capture groups themselves (e.g. `(foo)+`) are not allowed
- **No capture group** → the entire match is used as the replacement value
- **Capture group spanning the entire match** (e.g. `^(.*)$`) is currently rejected by the UI and will soon be rejected by the API — if you want the full tag value, use tag interpolation (`{{service}}`) instead of a regex

**Five remapping patterns:**

| Pattern                  | User says…                                                         | Filter example                    | New name example           |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| **N:1 group**            | "These N services are all the same thing"                          | `peer.service:*.shopify.com`      | `shopify`                  |
| **Strip suffix/prefix**  | "The name has junk at the end/start"                               | `service:*.tropos`                | `{{service\|^(.+?)\..*$}}` |
| **1:1 rename**           | "We renamed this service and Datadog needs to match"               | `service:old-auth-service`        | `auth-service`             |
| **Env split**            | "I want separate services per env but they all have the same name" | `service:my-service AND env:prod` | `my-service-prod`          |
| **Prefix normalization** | "All services should start with an env or team name"               | `service:payments*`               | `{{env}}-{{service}}`      |

---

## Triggers

Invoke this skill when the user wants to:

- Rename a service in Datadog without re-instrumenting
- Collapse multiple inferred service names into one (e.g. many `api.shopify.com/*` variants → `shopify`)
- Strip environment suffixes, version tags, or deployment metadata baked into service names
- Normalize `peer.service` names to something meaningful
- Rename a service after an org change, product rebrand, or migration
- Split a single service into per-env variants (`my-service` + `env:prod` → `my-service-prod`)
- List, review, or delete existing service remapping rules

Do NOT invoke this skill if:

- The user wants to rename the service in their application code — that requires a tracer config change (`DD_SERVICE`), not a remapping rule
- The user wants to correlate telemetry across infrastructure tags — that is the "Correlate telemetry" action type in the UI, not remapping

## Prerequisites

### pup-cli: check, install, and authenticate

### Claude runs

```bash
pup --version
```

If not found:

### Claude runs

```bash
brew tap datadog-labs/pack
brew install pup
```

Check auth:

```bash
pup auth status
```

If not authenticated:

### Claude runs

```bash
pup auth login
```

> This opens a browser tab for OAuth. Complete the login there — Claude will continue once the command exits.

### Credentials for write operations

`pup apm service-remapping list` and `get` work with OAuth. Create, update, and delete require API keys (`DD_API_KEY`, `DD_APP_KEY`, `DD_SITE`) until `apm_service_renaming_write` is added to pup's OAuth scopes.

### Claude runs

```bash
echo "DD_API_KEY set: $([ -n "${DD_API_KEY:-}" ] && echo yes || echo no)"
echo "DD_APP_KEY set: $([ -n "${DD_APP_KEY:-}" ] && echo yes || echo no)"
echo "DD_SITE: ${DD_SITE:-not set (defaulting to datadoghq.com)}"
```

If any are missing and you need to create/update/delete rules:

### What you need to do in a terminal

```bash
export DD_API_KEY=<your-api-key>
export DD_APP_KEY=<your-app-key>
export DD_SITE=datadoghq.com   # adjust for your site
```

> Common sites: `datadoghq.com` (US1), `datadoghq.eu` (EU1), `us3.datadoghq.com`, `us5.datadoghq.com`, `ap1.datadoghq.com`

Wait for the user to set credentials, then re-run the check above before continuing.

## Context to resolve before acting

| Variable           | How to resolve                                                                                                                                                     |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `ENV`              | Required before creating the rule (Step 4). Ask the user — do NOT assume `prod`. Read-only verification and impact preview do not need `ENV` and should run first. |
| `ORIGINAL_SERVICE` | Current service name(s) to remap — discover with `pup apm services list` or ask the user                                                                           |
| `ENTITY_TYPE`      | Instrumented service (`rule_type: 0`) or inferred entity (`rule_type: 1`)? Ask if unclear — see Domain Knowledge                                                   |
| `TARGET_NAME`      | The desired new service name — ask the user                                                                                                                        |
| `PATTERN`          | Which pattern applies — identify from the user's description (see Domain Knowledge above)                                                                          |

---

## Step 0: Discover Current Service Names

If the user hasn't specified exact names to remap, discover what exists first:

### Claude runs

```bash
pup apm services list --from 1h          # use --env <ENV> to target a single environment
pup traces search --query "service:<PARTIAL_NAME>" --from 1h --limit 20
```

Use the output to help the user identify exact service names. Ask the user to confirm which names they want remapped before proceeding.

---

## Step 1: Build the Rule

Work through each component before writing any JSON.

### 1a. Check for integration override names

Some service names (e.g. `grpc-client`, `net/http`, `aws.s3`, `redis`) are **integration-generated overrides** — the tracer auto-tags spans with them based on the library being used, not a user-set `service` tag. Remapping these with a service remapping rule is the wrong tool: the override is injected per-span by the integration, so the remapped name will keep re-appearing unless the override itself is removed.

**How to detect:** if the service name looks like a well-known integration name (single-word library names, `<protocol>-<client>` patterns, `<vendor>.<resource>` patterns), ask the user:

> _"The name `<SERVICE>` looks like an integration override — a name the tracer sets automatically on spans from the `<LIBRARY>` integration, not a user-configured service name. Service remapping won't stick here because the override is re-applied on every span. The right fix is **integration override removal**, which strips these auto-names so the parent service's name propagates instead. This is currently only configurable in the Datadog UI under APM → Setup → Service Remapping → Integration Override Removal. Do you want to handle it there, or proceed with a remapping rule anyway?"_

If the user confirms it is an integration override, stop here and direct them to the UI. Do not create a remapping rule.

### 1b. Entity type

[DECISION: entity type — ask the user if unclear]

- Does the service appear because a tracer explicitly set its `service` tag? → `rule_type: 0` (SERVICE)
- Does it appear in the service map from outbound calls (e.g. a database, queue, or external API)? → `rule_type: 1` (INFERRED_ENTITY)

If the user wants to remap an inferred entity, verify `peer.service` is set before proceeding — see the prerequisite in Domain Knowledge. If it is not set, stop and ask the user to enable `DD_TRACE_PEER_SERVICE_DEFAULTS_ENABLED=true` first.

### 1c. Filter

Write a single event-grammar query string targeting the service(s) to remap. Use the filter syntax and pattern table in Domain Knowledge to pick the right form. **State the filter expression verbatim in the planned-rule preview (Step 3)** — it is the user's primary way to verify the rule will match the intended entities, and they cannot evaluate the rule without it.

### 1d. New name (`value`)

Use the new name syntax and regex table in Domain Knowledge to pick the right form. For regex values, apply the constraints listed there.

### 1e. Rule name

Suggest a descriptive name. Examples:

- `collapse-shopify-inferred-services`
- `strip-tropos-suffix`
- `rename-old-auth-to-auth-service`
- `env-split-my-service-prod`

---

## Step 2: Preview Impact

Before constructing the JSON, check what will be affected:

### Claude runs

```bash
# Confirm telemetry exists for the targeted service (zero spans = wrong query or wrong env)
pup traces search --query "service:<ORIGINAL_SERVICE>" --from 15m --limit 5

# Check for monitors referencing the old service name
pup monitors list | grep -i "<ORIGINAL_SERVICE>"

# Check for dashboards referencing the old service name
pup dashboards list | grep -i "<ORIGINAL_SERVICE>"

# List existing service remapping rules that may conflict
pup apm service-remapping list
```

Report to the user:

| Item                  | What to surface                                                                                                                 |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Telemetry volume**  | Non-zero spans confirm the filter will match real data. Zero = likely wrong service name or env.                                |
| **Monitors**          | Any monitor referencing the old service name will silently break after remapping. List them and offer to update.                |
| **Dashboards**        | Any dashboard with the old service name in its title will have stale references after remapping. List them and offer to update. |
| **Conflicting rules** | Existing rules targeting the same service may be overridden. Show conflicts and ask the user to confirm.                        |

**Known gaps — Claude cannot verify these automatically:**

Remapping a service name can also break the following. Claude has no `pup` commands to check them today, so surface this as a manual checklist for the user before they confirm:

> _"Before I create this rule, please verify `<ORIGINAL_SERVICE>` is not referenced in any of the following — they won't update automatically after remapping:_
>
> - _Spans-to-metrics rules (APM → Setup → Generate Metrics)_
> - _Trace-to-metrics rules_
> - _Span retention filters (APM → Setup → Retention Filters)_
> - _Logs-to-metrics rules (Logs → Generate Metrics)_
> - _Any pipeline, alert, or SLO that acts on the service name_"

If monitors reference the old service name, ask:

> _"I found `<N>` monitor(s) referencing `<ORIGINAL_SERVICE>`. After remapping, they'll need to be updated to use `<TARGET_NAME>`. Want me to update them now?"_

---

## Step 3: Confirm the Rule

Show the user the planned rule and confirm before creating. **Batch any unresolved context variables into this same prompt** — do not ask for them in a separate earlier turn. One round-trip, not two.

If the filter doesn't already scope to an environment, ask whether to add one — env scoping is done by appending `AND env:<ENV>` to the filter expression, not via a separate API parameter.

> _"I'm planning rule `<RULE_NAME>` with filter `<FILTER>` mapping `<ORIGINAL_SERVICE>` → `<TARGET_NAME>` (rule_type: `<TYPE>`). Should this be scoped to a specific environment? If so, I'll add `AND env:<ENV>` to the filter. Is this OK to proceed?"_

Wait for confirmation before continuing.

---

## Step 4: Create the Rule

### Claude runs

```bash
pup apm service-remapping create \
  --name "<RULE_NAME>" \
  --filter "<FILTER>" \
  --rule-type <TYPE> \
  --value "<TARGET_NAME>"
```

If the response contains an `id` field — creation succeeded. Record the `id` and `version` values from the response.

ERROR: `400 Bad Request` with "Filter expression has invalid syntax" — the filter query is malformed. Check glob syntax and boolean operators.

ERROR: `400 Bad Request` with "Template value in target name is invalid" — the `value` regex is invalid. Check: max 1 capture group, non-greedy quantifiers inside groups (`(.+?)` not `(.+)`).

ERROR: `401 Unauthorized` — credentials are invalid or expired. Re-check `DD_API_KEY` and `DD_APP_KEY`.

ERROR: `403 Forbidden` — the API key lacks `apm_service_renaming_write` permission.

---

## Step 5: Verify

Allow 2–5 minutes for the rule to propagate, then confirm it is active.

### For SERVICE rules (rule_type 0)

### Claude runs

```bash
# Confirm new service name appears in APM
pup apm services list --env <ENV> --from 5m

# Confirm traces are arriving under the new name
pup traces search --query "service:<TARGET_NAME>" --from 5m --limit 5
```

If `<TARGET_NAME>` appears in either — rule is active.

### For INFERRED_ENTITY rules (rule_type 1)

Inferred entities don't produce their own spans, so they won't appear in `pup apm services list` or `pup traces search`. Verify in two steps:

**Step 5a — confirm the rule is stored correctly:**

### Claude runs

```bash
pup apm service-remapping get <RULE_ID>
```

Confirm the filter and value match what you intended.

**Step 5b — confirm the entity name changed in the service map:**

Ask the user to check the APM Service Map in the Datadog UI and look for `<TARGET_NAME>` where `<ORIGINAL_SERVICE>` used to appear. The service map is the authoritative view for inferred entity names.

Alternatively, confirm new `peer.service` values are arriving on spans from the instrumented service:

### Claude runs

```bash
pup traces search --query "service:<INSTRUMENTED_SERVICE> @peer.service:<TARGET_NAME>" --from 5m --limit 5
```

If spans appear with `peer.service:<TARGET_NAME>` — rule is active.

ERROR: New name not appearing after 5 minutes:

- Confirm old service is still sending traces with the original `peer.service`: `pup traces search --query "@peer.service:<ORIGINAL_SERVICE>" --from 5m`
- If old name still appears, propagation may still be in progress — wait 2 more minutes and retry
- If neither name appears, confirm `DD_TRACE_PEER_SERVICE_DEFAULTS_ENABLED=true` is set on the instrumented service — without it `peer.service` is never set and the rule will never fire

---

## Managing Existing Rules

### List all rules

### Claude runs

```bash
pup apm service-remapping list
```

### Get a single rule

### Claude runs

```bash
pup apm service-remapping get <RULE_ID>
```

### Update a rule

Update requires the current `version` from list/get output. Show the proposed changes to the user and confirm before running:

### Claude runs

```bash
pup apm service-remapping update <RULE_ID> \
  --name "<RULE_NAME>" \
  --filter "<FILTER>" \
  --rule-type <TYPE> \
  --value "<NEW_NAME>" \
  --version <VERSION>
```

ERROR: `409 Conflict` — the rule was modified since you fetched it. Re-fetch with `get` to get the current version and retry.

### Delete a rule

Show the user the rule's name and filter first, then ask for confirmation. Delete requires both the rule `id` and `version` from the list/get output:

### Claude runs

```bash
pup apm service-remapping delete <RULE_ID> <RULE_VERSION>
```

ERROR: `409 Conflict` — the rule was modified since you fetched it. Re-fetch with `get` to get the current version and retry.

---

## Done

Exit when ALL of the following are true:

- [ ] Rule shown to user and confirmed before creation
- [ ] Rule created and `id` returned in response
- [ ] For SERVICE rules: new service name visible in `pup apm services list` or `pup traces search`
- [ ] For INFERRED_ENTITY rules: user confirmed new entity name appears in APM Service Map, or spans show `peer.service:<TARGET_NAME>`
- [ ] Impacted monitors identified and offered for update
- [ ] User confirmed the remapping matches their intent

---

## Security constraints

- Never write a raw API key into any file or chat message — always use `$DD_API_KEY` and `$DD_APP_KEY`
- Never create or delete a rule without explicit user confirmation — show the full rule before creating
- Never assume `prod` as the environment — always confirm with the user
- Never run DELETE without showing the user the rule's name and filter first
