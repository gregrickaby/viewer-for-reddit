/**
 * Skeleton for `.auto_experiment/eval_harness.mjs` (ESM, Node >= 18).
 *
 * The Node/JavaScript counterpart of `eval_harness_template.py`. Use this when the code under test
 * (`files_to_optimize`) is a Node.js/TypeScript project. It is functionally identical to the Python
 * template and MUST emit the SAME stdout JSON contract — the loop is language-agnostic and only
 * reads that contract, so a Node harness and a Python harness are interchangeable to the loop.
 *
 * The `.mjs` extension makes this unambiguously an ES module, so it runs standalone regardless of
 * whether the target repo's package.json sets `"type": "module"`.
 *
 * Copy this into `.auto_experiment/eval_harness.mjs` in iteration 1, then fill in the two TODOs:
 * `generateOutput` (run the REAL code under test) and `judge` (a REAL LLM-as-judge call, OR a
 * deterministic ground-truth check — prefer the latter).
 *
 * Hard rules (see references/rubrics.md — they are language-agnostic):
 *   * NO score literals / hard-coded score arrays anywhere in this file. Every score is returned
 *     by `judge()` running over real data.
 *   * Score only scoreable target lines; EXCLUDE non-target/infra lines from the mean entirely
 *     (do not score them 0). The runner below skips a line when `generateOutput` returns null.
 *   * The harness is written ONCE and reused verbatim across iterations — only the code under
 *     test (imported by `generateOutput`) changes between iterations.
 *
 * Usage: `node .auto_experiment/eval_harness.mjs`  -> writes eval_results.jsonl, prints
 *   {"mean", "stdev", "runs", "scored", "excluded", "run_means"}.
 *   (If the code under test is TypeScript, run with `npx tsx .auto_experiment/eval_harness.mjs` so
 *    `await import(...)` can load the `.ts` entrypoint directly.)
 *
 * Noise: `generateOutput` (and an LLM judge) are stochastic, so a single run's mean is a noisy
 * estimate. The runner re-runs the WHOLE eval `AUTO_EXP_RUNS` times (default 3) and reports the
 * mean-of-runs plus the across-run stdev. The loop feeds that stdev into the standard error of the
 * difference of means, `SE_diff = sqrt(sd_cand^2/n + sd_best^2/n)`, and keeps a change as best
 * whenever its point estimate improves in the goal's direction (and passes the mechanism audit).
 * The two-sample t-test (`|Δ|/SE_diff >= 2`, or `|Δ| >= min_delta` when SE_diff is 0) is a
 * CONFIDENCE label — a higher-in-direction move only within noise is kept but flagged tentative,
 * not discarded — NOT a keep gate, and NOT a raw-stdev band (raw stdev doesn't shrink with runs).
 * Only the mean/stdev are computed here; the gate itself lives in the loop. See
 * references/rubrics.md "Noise & keep/discard policy". Point at a specific data split with
 * `AUTO_EXP_DATA` (default data.jsonl).
