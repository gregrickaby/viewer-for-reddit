description: Guides developers building Datadog Apps with TypeScript, React, the @datadog/apps scaffolder, and @datadog/vite-plugin. Use when a user wants to scaffold, run, debug, upgrade, build, upload, publish, upload without publishing (draft upload), add an upload-no-publish script, set up CI/CD, use OAuth or API/application key auth, trigger/poll Workflow Automation, choose DDSQL or Action Catalog for backend data access, or query app datastores with DDSQL, including backend function troubleshooting.

# Datadog Apps

Use this skill when a developer is building a Datadog Apps project with TypeScript, React, published packages, and the normal production Datadog site. If the user is modifying Datadog platform packages or testing package source changes, use a platform-engineer-oriented workflow instead.

## Overview

Datadog Apps are locally developed web apps built with React and TypeScript or JavaScript. Use Apps when a project needs source control, code review, CI/CD, multi-engineer collaboration, AI-assisted local development, custom UI or logic, or backend code that integrates with services beyond low-code App Builder. Apps share App Builder's permissions model and can be embedded in Datadog surfaces such as dashboards and the Internal Developer Portal.

## Reference Routing

Read only the reference needed for the user's task:

| User task                                                                                                                            | Read                                           |

| Build, upload, publish, upload without publishing, add upload-no-publish script, configure Datadog site, or understand upload output | `references/build-upload-publish.md`           |
| Add or update GitHub Actions deployment                                                                                              | `references/cicd.md`                           |
| Trigger or poll Workflow Automation from a backend function                                                                          | `references/workflow-http-trigger.md`          |
| Get started querying data from a Datadog App                                                                                         | `references/querying-data/getting-started.md`  |
| Understand or configure Action Catalog connections                                                                                   | `references/querying-data/connections.md`      |
| Query Datadog App datastores with DDSQL                                                                                              | `references/querying-data/ddsql/datastores.md` |
| Upgrade Datadog Apps dependencies or compare with a freshly scaffolded app                                                           | `references/upgrading.md`                      |
| Diagnose OAuth, API/application key auth, upload, Node, site, or backend function failures                                           | `references/troubleshooting.md`                |

## Boundaries

- After scaffolding or when working inside an existing app, read the app project's `AGENTS.md` before making changes.
- For backend function implementation details, rely on the generated app project's `AGENTS.md`; this skill only covers local development auth choices and troubleshooting.
- Preserve the app project's existing package manager, scripts, Datadog site, and repository conventions.
- Do not cover Datadog package/platform development in this skill.
- Low-code App Builder to Datadog Apps migration guidance is future work. Do not invent a migration process yet.
