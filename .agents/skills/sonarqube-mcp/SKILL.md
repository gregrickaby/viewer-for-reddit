# SonarQube MCP Integration

Leverage SonarQube and SonarCloud capabilities directly through the Model Context Protocol (MCP) server to enforce code quality, discover issues, and run pre-push analysis inside the agent workflow.

## Overview

This skill provides instructions and patterns for using the [SonarQube MCP Server](https://github.com/SonarSource/sonarqube-mcp-server) tools. It enables automated workflows for:

- Checking quality gate status before merges or deployments
- Discovering and triaging issues by severity and project
- Analyzing code snippets locally before committing (shift-left)
- Understanding SonarQube rules with full documentation

## When to Use

Use this skill when:

- The user wants to check if a project passes its quality gate before merging a PR
- The user wants to find critical or blocker issues in one or more SonarQube projects
- The user wants to analyze a code snippet for issues before pushing to CI
- The user wants to understand why a specific Sonar rule flagged their code
- The user asks for pre-commit or pre-push quality feedback

**Trigger phrases:** "check quality gate", "sonarqube quality gate", "find sonar issues", "search sonar issues", "analyze code with sonar", "check sonar rule", "sonarcloud issues", "pre-push sonar check", "sonar pre-commit"

## Prerequisites and Setup

The plugin includes a `.mcp.json` that starts the SonarQube MCP Server automatically via Docker. Before using this skill, set the required environment variables:

**SonarQube Server (remote or local):**
```bash
export SONARQUBE_TOKEN="squ_your_token"
export SONARQUBE_URL="https://sonarqube.mycompany.com"  # or http://host.docker.internal:9000 for local Docker
```

**SonarCloud:**
```bash
export SONARQUBE_TOKEN="squ_your_token"
export SONARQUBE_ORG="your-org-key"   # required for SonarCloud
# SONARQUBE_URL is not needed for SonarCloud
```

**Requirements:**
- Docker must be installed and running
- `SONARQUBE_TOKEN` is always required
- `SONARQUBE_URL` is required for SonarQube Server (use `host.docker.internal` for local instances)
- `SONARQUBE_ORG` is required for SonarCloud (omit `SONARQUBE_URL` in that case)

## Quick Start

1. Set your SonarQube/SonarCloud credentials:
   ```bash
   # SonarQube Server
   export SONARQUBE_TOKEN="squ_your_token"
   export SONARQUBE_URL="https://sonarqube.mycompany.com"

   # SonarCloud
   export SONARQUBE_TOKEN="squ_your_token"
   export SONARQUBE_ORG="your-org-key"
   ```

2. Verify MCP tool availability:
   - Tool names follow the pattern: `mcp__sonarqube-mcp__<tool-name>`

3. If the MCP server fails to start, check:
   - Docker is running
   - Environment variables are set
   - Reference: [mcp/sonarqube on Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/mcp/sonarqube)

## Instructions

### Step 1: Identify the Required Operation

Determine which operation the user needs:

| User Intent | Tool to Use |
|---|---|
| Check if project passes quality gate | `get_project_quality_gate_status` |
| Find critical issues in a project | `search_sonar_issues_in_projects` |
| Analyze code before committing | `analyze_code_snippet` |
| Understand a flagged rule | `show_rule` |
| Get detailed project metrics | `get_component_measures` |
| Mark an issue as false positive | `change_sonar_issue_status` |

If the user's intent is ambiguous, ask for the project key and the goal before proceeding.

### Step 2: Quality Gate Monitoring

Use `get_project_quality_gate_status` to verify a project meets its quality standards.

**Parameters:**
- `projectKey` (string) — Project key in SonarQube/SonarCloud
- `pullRequest` (string, optional) — Pull request ID for PR-specific gate check
- `analysisId` (string, optional) — Specific analysis ID

> Note: There is no `branch` parameter on this tool. Without a `pullRequest` or `analysisId`, the tool returns the quality gate status for the default branch.

**Pattern — Check default branch gate:**

```json
{
  "name": "get_project_quality_gate_status",
  "arguments": {
    "projectKey": "my-application"
  }
}
```

**Pattern — Check PR gate before merge:**

```json
{
  "name": "get_project_quality_gate_status",
  "arguments": {
    "projectKey": "backend-service",
    "pullRequest": "456"
  }
}
```

**Interpreting the response:**
- `status: "OK"` — Gate passed, safe to merge/deploy
- `status: "ERROR"` — Gate failed; check `conditions` array for failing metrics
- Each condition shows: `metricKey`, `actualValue`, `errorThreshold`, `comparator`

For more on metric keys, see `references/metrics.md`.

### Step 3: Issue Discovery and Triaging

Use `search_sonar_issues_in_projects` to find and prioritize issues.

**Parameters:**
- `projects` (array, optional) — List of project keys; omit to search all accessible projects
- `severities` (array, optional) — Filter: `BLOCKER`, `HIGH`, `MEDIUM`, `LOW`, `INFO`
- `pullRequestId` (string, optional) — Limit search to a specific PR
- `p` (integer, optional) — Page number (default: 1)
- `ps` (integer, optional) — Page size (default: 100, max: 500)

**Pattern — Find blockers and critical issues:**

```json
{
  "name": "search_sonar_issues_in_projects",
  "arguments": {
    "projects": ["my-backend", "my-frontend"],
    "severities": ["BLOCKER", "HIGH"],
    "p": 1,
    "ps": 50
  }
}
```

**Pattern — Search issues in a PR:**

```json
{
  "name": "search_sonar_issues_in_projects",
  "arguments": {
    "projects": ["my-service"],
    "pullRequestId": "123",
    "severities": ["HIGH", "MEDIUM"],
    "p": 1,
    "ps": 100
  }
}
```

**Managing issues with `change_sonar_issue_status`:**

Use this to mark false positives or accepted technical debt:

```json
{
  "name": "change_sonar_issue_status",
  "arguments": {
    "key": "AY1234",
    "status": "falsepositive",
    "comment": "This pattern is safe in our context because..."
  }
}
```

Valid statuses: `falsepositive` (not a real issue), `accept` (acknowledged technical debt), `reopen` (reset to open)

> Always present the list of issues to the user before changing their status. Never autonomously mark issues as false positives without explicit user confirmation.

### Step 4: Pre-Push Analysis (Shift Left)

Use `analyze_code_snippet` to run SonarQube analysis on code before committing.

**Parameters:**
- `projectKey` (string) — Project key for context
- `fileContent` (string, **required**) — Full content of the file to analyze
- `language` (string, optional) — Language hint for better accuracy
- `codeSnippet` (string, optional) — Narrow results to a specific sub-range within `fileContent`

**Supported languages:** `javascript`, `typescript`, `python`, `java`, `go`, `php`, `cs`, `cpp`, `kotlin`, `ruby`, `scala`, `swift`

**Pattern — Analyze TypeScript file before commit:**

```json
{
  "name": "analyze_code_snippet",
  "arguments": {
    "projectKey": "my-typescript-app",
    "fileContent": "async function fetchUser(id: string) {\n  const query = `SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ${id}`;\n  return db.execute(query);\n}",
    "language": "typescript"
  }
}
```

**Pattern — Analyze Python file:**

```json
{
  "name": "analyze_code_snippet",
  "arguments": {
    "projectKey": "my-python-service",
    "fileContent": "import pickle\n\ndef load_model(path):\n    with open(path, 'rb') as f:\n        return pickle.load(f)",
    "language": "python"
  }
}
```

**Response interpretation:**
- Each issue includes: `ruleKey`, severity, clean code attribute, impact category, line number, quick fix availability
- Address `CRITICAL` and `HIGH` severity issues before committing
- Use `show_rule` with the `ruleKey` value for any unfamiliar rule

### Step 5: Rule Education

Use `show_rule` to understand why a rule exists and how to fix flagged code.

**Parameters:**
- `key` (string) — Rule key in format `<language>:<rule-id>` (e.g., `typescript:S1082`, `java:S2068`)

**Pattern — Get rule documentation:**

```json
{
  "name": "show_rule",
  "arguments": {
    "key": "typescript:S1082"
  }
}
```

**Response includes:** rule name, type, severity, full description, tags (e.g., `cwe`, `owasp-a2`), language, remediation effort estimate, code examples (non-compliant vs compliant).

### Step 6: Get Component Measures

Use `get_component_measures` to retrieve detailed metrics for a project, directory, or file.

**Parameters:**
- `projectKey` (string) — Project key in SonarQube/SonarCloud
- `pullRequest` (string, optional) — PR ID for PR-scoped metrics
- `metricKeys` (array) — List of metric keys to retrieve

**Common metric keys:** `coverage`, `bugs`, `vulnerabilities`, `code_smells`, `complexity`, `cognitive_complexity`, `ncloc`, `duplicated_lines_density`, `new_coverage`, `new_bugs`

**Pattern — Project health dashboard:**

```json
{
  "name": "get_component_measures",
  "arguments": {
    "projectKey": "my-project-key",
    "metricKeys": ["coverage", "bugs", "vulnerabilities", "code_smells", "ncloc"]
  }
}
```

For full metric reference, see `references/metrics.md`.

### Step 7: Present Results to User

After each tool call:
- Summarize findings in human-readable form
- Flag issues that require attention (BLOCKER, HIGH severity)
- Propose next actions based on findings
- Wait for user confirmation before taking remediation steps (e.g., changing issue status, modifying code)

## Examples

### Example 1: Pre-Merge Quality Gate Check

**User request:** "Check if the quality gate passes for project `backend-api` on PR #234"

```json
{
  "name": "get_project_quality_gate_status",
  "arguments": {
    "projectKey": "backend-api",
    "pullRequest": "234"
  }
}
```

**If gate fails:** Extract failing conditions, present them to the user, then use `search_sonar_issues_in_projects` filtered by the same PR to show the actual issues.

### Example 2: Shift-Left Analysis Before Push

**User request:** "Analyze this Go function before I push it"

```json
{
  "name": "analyze_code_snippet",
  "arguments": {
    "projectKey": "my-go-service",
    "fileContent": "func handler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {\n  id := r.URL.Query().Get(\"id\")\n  query := fmt.Sprintf(\"SELECT * FROM orders WHERE id = %s\", id)\n  rows, _ := db.Query(query)\n  // ...\n}",
    "language": "go"
  }
}
```

Present findings → for each issue, optionally call `show_rule` with the `ruleKey` value to explain the fix.

### Example 3: Triage BLOCKER Issues in a Project

**User request:** "Show me all blocker issues in `payment-service`"

```json
{
  "name": "search_sonar_issues_in_projects",
  "arguments": {
    "projects": ["payment-service"],
    "severities": ["BLOCKER"],
    "p": 1,
    "ps": 50
  }
}
```

Group results by category (Security, Reliability, Maintainability) and present to user. Offer to call `show_rule` for unfamiliar rules.

## Best Practices

1. **Environment Setup** — Set credentials once per session; the MCP server automatically picks them up
2. **Always check quality gate before merge** — Run `get_project_quality_gate_status` as part of any PR review workflow
3. **Shift left on security issues** — Use `analyze_code_snippet` during development, not only in CI
4. **Prioritize by severity** — Address BLOCKER and HIGH issues first; document decisions for MEDIUM and LOW
5. **Use `show_rule` for unfamiliar keys** — Never dismiss a rule without understanding its intent
6. **Paginate large result sets** — Use `p` and `ps` parameters; handle multi-page responses for complete coverage
7. **Never change issue status autonomously** — Always present issues to the user and get explicit confirmation before calling `change_sonar_issue_status`
8. **Provide language hints** — Specify `language` in `analyze_code_snippet` for more accurate analysis

## Constraints and Warnings

- MCP server must be configured and running; verify tool availability before use
- `analyze_code_snippet` analyzes snippets in isolation — full project context may affect results in CI
- Issue status changes (false positive, won't fix) require appropriate SonarQube permissions
- SonarCloud and SonarQube Server APIs are mostly compatible but some features differ; check `references/llm-context.md`
- Pagination is required for projects with many issues; check `paging.total` and `paging.pageSize` in the response to determine whether to iterate further pages
- Quality gate status reflects the last completed analysis — trigger a new analysis if the code has changed
