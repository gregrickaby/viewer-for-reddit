  As a user,
  I want to use swipe gestures
  So that I can easily navigate through content.

Scenario: Swipe left to dismiss
  Given the user is on the viewer screen
  When the user swipes left on a Reddit post
  Then the post should be dismissed from the view.

Scenario: Swipe right to bookmark
  Given the user is on the viewer screen
